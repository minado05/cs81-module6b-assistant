What made my assistant "personal" to me is that it is tailored towards my tasks and mood.
I did not face any challenge in using `this` because I felt comfortable with using `this` coming into this assignment.
A method that I would expand is the completeTask method. I want to expand it to change the mood depending on the task completed and also print the number of the remaining tasks left.
